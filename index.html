			<h2>Post #3</h2>
			<p>
				It's up now on Github <a href="https://github.com/pattj/dndapp">click here!</a> Woooooo.
				
			</p>
			<p>
	                       So far so good, I made modules for characters and monsters and I think I'm making decent progress so far since I
	    			started 10 days ago. Balancing this and studying Leetcode problems and work was not fun.
	    	         </p>
			 	
		          <p>
	    			For characters, I hardcoded some character objects and made a table of characters on the html template (for the character component)
				The table is supposed to represent a list of characters  that a specific user has created. I also added a filter bar as well so that a user
                               can look up a specific character faster by typing in a specific attribute. The characters are hard coded right now, so eventually I would like
                               for everything (users and their list of characters ) to be stored in a database that is accessed by Web API (that I'll
                               have to code up later once I'm satisied with my progress on the monster component) </p>
                          <p>
			     The monsters component was where most of my time went into. I'm currently leveraging this D&D API called Open5e.
			     I like it alot, whoever made it has done a really good job. So far, I slaped on a dropdown selection list onto the component,
		             which is then populated by the name of the monsters the I got from the Open5e API. Then whatever name the user choosed from the list is then
		             bind to the "selectedMonster" from my "monster-info" component so that the component can create a card filled with the selected monster's info
		             onto the screen.
				   
		          </p>  
                            <img src="monstercomponent.PNG" height ="50%" width = "50%">  
	                  <p>
				The most annoying part was dealing with the paged API. You see, the list of monsters on the Open5e API
				are split up into 7 pages. This means that I would have to call it 7 times (because there are 7 pages) and 
				concatenate the result into one array. This sounds pretty simple but don't forget that these calls are asynchronous, so it's not 
				like I can just throw it in a loop because of how Observables work (as the responds won't come back at the same time). This post is already pretty long so I'll go into more detail
				 in my next post.

			<h2>Post #2</h2>
			<p>
				Currently I'm interested in learning more about Angular because I like how it sort of compartmentalize 
				the project which makes replacing/improving something pretty easy. It's also another opportunity for me to 
				learn more about frontend development as well. I have been watching videos on <a href="https://scrimba.com/playlist/pQxesM">
				Scrimba </a> which is pretty cool as it uses screencasting and makes following along very easy (since I get to try it out myself).
				
			</p>
			
			<p>
				Eventually I would like to create a project which uses the latest version Angular as my frontend to go along with
				the .NET Core API for my backend. I want this project to be based on Dungeons and Dragons where people can sign up
				and use it to manage their characters and campaigns. The users's data (their usernames, passwords, characters and so on) will be stored 
				inside a database so, I'm going to have to create an my own API to access it as well.
			</p>
	    
	    		<p>
				Another thing I would like to do is something that involves this blog. Currently, whenever I make a post,
				I would just go inside the HTML file and slap an "article" tag along with whatever the post is going to be about inside the tag
				onto the file. I don't see this scaling very well in the future, imagine if I have like 100 posts on that HTML file, whenever the page loads
				the browser would have to render the entire file which would be a real pain. For scalability's sake, I imagine that I would have to:
				<ul>
				<li>Create a database to store all my blog posts</li>
				<li>Write an API to access the database</li>
				<li>Write some sort of javascript code to use the API to get my blog posts on to the actual blog</li>
				<li>Implement some sort of paging or lazy loading feature to limit the number of post that can appear at once</li>		
				<ul>
				
			</p>	
			
				<p>
				For now the D&D project sounds more fun so I think I'll focus more on that!

				<em>A generation ago</em>, the astronomer <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/carl_sagan">Carl Sagan</a> stood here and launched hundreds of millions of us on a great adventure the exploration of the universe revealed by science.
				It's time to get going again.
				We're about to begin a journey that will take us from the infinitesimal to the infinite, from the dawn of time to the distant future.
				We'll explore galaxies and suns and worlds, surf the gravity waves of space-time, encounter beings that live in fire and ice, explore the planets of stars that never die, discover atoms as massive as suns and universes smaller than atoms.
			</p>
                 
			<h3>COSMOS IS ALSO A STORY ABOUT US</h3>
			<p>
				It's the saga of how wandering bands of hunters and gatherers found their way to the stars, one adventure with many heroes.
				To make this journey, we'll need imagination.
				But imagination alone is not enough because the reality of nature is far more wondrous than anything we can imagine.
				This adventure is made possible by generations of searchers strictly adhering to a simple set of rules test ideas by experiment and observation, build on those ideas that pass the test, reject the ones that fail, follow the evidence wherever it leads and question everything.
				<strong>Accept these terms, and the cosmos is yours.</strong>
